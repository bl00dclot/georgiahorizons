  <CardContent>
    <p>Georgian folk music is renowned for its rich melodies and ancient traditions. Unique regional instruments like the <strong>panduri</strong> (a three-string fretted lute) and the <strong>chonguri</strong> (a four-string lute from western Georgia) often accompany polyphonic singing. The <strong>duduki</strong> (a double-reed woodwind made from apricot wood) produces soft, mournful tones and is traditionally played solo or in ensembles. The simple <strong>salamuri</strong> flute has been played since ancient times. Georgian polyphony—three or more interweaving vocal parts—has been recognized by UNESCO as a cultural treasure, with regional styles ranging from Svaneti’s mountain three-part songs to Kakheti’s dialogic harmonies and western trio improvisations.</p>

Women wear the elegant <strong>kartuli</strong> gown with ornate bodices, full skirts, and distinctive headdresses like layered veils (<em>lechaki</em>) and decorative caps. Today, these costumes are showcased in museums, at weddings, and by folk ensembles, offering a vivid glimpse into Georgia&apos;s sartorial heritage.</p>

    <p>Georgian dance is celebrated for its athleticism and storytelling, with national costumes enhancing the spectacle. <strong>Kartuli</strong> is a graceful couple’s dance symbolizing courtship—partners never touch as he bows and she glides. <strong>Khorumi</strong>, a men’s war dance from Guria, reenacts raids and battles with precise footwork. The playful mixed-gender <strong>Acharuli</strong> features lighthearted flirtation and swirling moves. Other dances like Partsa, Tbilisuri, and Khevsurian sword dances convey themes of love, bravery, and faith, preserving folk spirit across generations.</p>

    <p>The <strong>supra</strong> feast exemplifies Georgian hospitality: a <em>tamada</em> (toastmaster) leads ritual toasts about love, family, and homeland—no one drinks until the final “bolo mde.” Guests are seen as gifts from God, and hosts spare no effort to honor them. Multi-generational families cherish elders, and Orthodox Christianity—embraced since the 4th century—shapes life-cycle events and holidays. Bread, wine, and blessings unite communities in gratitude and resilience, inviting visitors to share in Georgia’s open-hearted warmth.</p>
